# Sea of Thieves Map Finder

This project was started and there is some preliminary work which was done to identify the distance between islands.
The data is downloaded of the wiki page and simply assumes the islands are centered in their associated coordinate - which is not true. This was going to be fixed by expanding out each *Block* into nine *Sub-Blocks* but this was never finished being implemented.
The player would use their phone to screenshot the current treasure maps after telling the application what dock they started at. It would then inform them which maps are the closest and furthers away in distance from their own current location.

The application was never finished since all my friends quit playing Sea of Thieves.
