## There are different phases of ideas which will be notated.
- **Completed** means a project is done and should no longer be getting updated.
- **Version <N> ** means that the project has been updated `<N>` times.
- **Minimum Viable Project** means that the project has been prototyped out and should work as intended.
- **Creative Notation** means that the project is simply an idea which is either being worked on or not yet.
- **Abandoned** means that the project either was not possible or was no longer relevant to my life anymore.
