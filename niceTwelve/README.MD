# 12 Data Science Apps in NiceGui
This is a conversion project from Streamlit to NiceGui which is from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM) by **Chanin Nantasenamat**.
The project is both to learn more about how to build applications in Nicegui along with some "practical" web applications for usage. These projects are baseline common enough that you're likely to use them as a template project for real world projects in the future.

Each project, when done, will have it's own directory for the working Web application along with where to find the uploaded hosted project. I finally got Huggingface working with these applications so that is where they will be.
